# Lecture 02
03/02 | 10:01: Created notebook.md <br>
03/02 | 10:10: Created project board for issues.<br>
- Issues with board not being public - fixed.

03/02 | 11:40: Imported and refactored Chirp to replace minitwit
- Copied chirp project files
- Refactored to remove OAuth
- Can be run with `dotnet run`.
- Confused about how we should handle tests. Asked TA - we need to choose what we want. Decided to cut and paste in current minitwit_tests.py file to make it work with Chirp.
